An animal drinking device comprises a body member 1 formed with a valve seat 6, a valve member 8 formed with a valve head 7 adapted to co-operate with the valve seat 6, and a valve stem 3a extending through a bore 2 so that tilting of the stem relative to the bore allows liquid to flow through the device, and wherein the body member is shaped relative to the bore so that the mouth of an animal can apply pressure between the stem 3a and the body 1. The asymmetry may be derived from a stepped portion (Fig. 2, not shown) or a slotted portion (Fig. 3, not shown) of the body 1. The valve stem may be in the form of a tube (Fig. 4, not shown) through which the animal receives the water."

A valve, e.g. for supplying livestock with liquid, is operated by relative tilting or axial displacement between valve stem 3 and body member 1 to unseat closure 4 and is provided with means to restrict the relative tilting to prevent opening in at least one direction so that e.g. the device may be used with the stem in a non-vertical position. The valve may also be opened by relative axial displacement against the spring 8 and, in one embodiment, is provided with a hollow drinking cup 5 through an opening 6 whereof the liquid is supplied to the animal's mouth. In an alternative embodiment (Figs. 4 and 5, not shown), the cup (5) is omitted and the valve is actuated directly from an axially projecting portion (3b) of the stem (3). The through bore in the body member 1 opens out from a relatively small cross-section at the end 2b, which may be longitudinally grooved to provide additional flow, to a larger cross-section 2c to accommodate the tilting. The tilting may be restricted in one direction by a stop comprising a transverse screw intersecting the bore, a segment-shaped plug inserted in the bore or a flat (10) (Fig. 2, not shown) formed on one side of the bore or the tilting may be restricted to one direction only by forming the bore as an elongated slot of the width of the stem (3) (Fig. 2a, not shown). The bore (2d) adjacent the valve seat (Figs. 4 and 5, not shown) may also be eccentric to the larger bore (3b) to provide the restriction to tilting. The stem (3) may additionally be provided with a tapered portion (11) in the region 2b of the bore adjacent the seat (Fig. 3, not shown) so that the through flow may be varied upon axial displacement of the stem. In a float operated tank supply valve (Fig. 6, not shown), a lip (15) of the float (13) shrouds the end of the body member (11) and tilting is restricted upwardly by any of the previously mentioned means, so that the valve remains closed when the tank is full, and the bore (2<SP>1</SP>) may be tapered. The float valve construction provides a \" snap \" closing action."

In the method for improving reproductive ability in female mammals by using ultraweak photon according to the present invention, light in the visible light band is used, but is transmitted in a weak form that is not visually perceptible, so it does not cause stress and allows safe irradiation for a long time, thereby improving the reproductive ability of female mammals. Conventional methods of feeding substances to improve reproductive ability are supplied in a consumptive manner, causing environmental pollution problems due to resistance and misuse. On the contrary, the method of the present invention is a useful alternative technology that can be used for a long time and ensures the sustainability of livestock farming. Accordingly, the method is a simple, practical, and eco-friendly method that can be applied to smart farming to safely improve the reproductive ability of female mammals. Therefore, farm productivity can be significantly improved."

        "abstract": "AI-BASED CROP RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM FOR SMART FARMING TOWARDS AGRICULTURE 5.0 According to a report of the Food and Agriculture Organization, the world population is projected to increase another two billion by 2050, while the arable region is expected to only grow by 5%. To increase productivity in agriculture, clever and effective agricultural techniques are therefore required. The determination of land adequacy for agriculture is a basic instrument for the growth of agriculture. Agriculture is using many emerging technologies and inventions as an approach to the gathering and distribution of agricultural knowledge. The rapid growth of wireless sensor networks has led to the creation of Internet of Things (IoT) of low cost and compact sensor devices, which are a feasible method for automating and making decisions in agriculture. This study proposes an expert framework for the evaluation of agricultural land suitability, by combining sensor networks with artificial intelligence systems such as neural networks and multi-component perceptron. This innovation would help farmers determine the farmland for agriculture according to four classes of judgment, i.e. more acceptable, suitable, reasonably appropriate and unsuitable. This measurement is based on the data from the different sensor instruments used for machine training. The results achieved by MLP with four hidden layers are seen in contrast to the other current model, to be successful for the multiclass classification system. This learned model is used to evaluate potential evaluations and to identify the land after each harvest.

The main advantage of SDEAM over other methods is that for a fixed location of the source elevation z\u2032, it does not require fitting from scratch for every z, z\u2032, and \u03c1 combination. Because of this advantage, SDEAM can be superior in both performance and accuracy to other existing methods.
