This system, HAMED FD, is a comprehensive one to do this and to help all the people around the world or even universe, when travelling to Moon or Mars for instance, disregarding of their race, religion, wealth, etc. It also could be useful for those that are in distant places without accessing to specialists (e.g. farmers), those who live in poor areas or those who travel to distant places without accessing to any specialist. HAMED FD is a completely automatic doctor for all plants (and also seeds) using artificial intelligence means (AI-Based). HAMED FD can help clients to know the best plants/seeds for agriculture in the farms, to watch and control plants/seeds and pests (if any), to control the quantity and quality of water, minerals, pesticides, and so on, and to identify/control if the plants/seeds are growing up normally and productively without human assistance (e.g. farmer help), and if soil, water and environmental conditions in which the plants are (or will be) cultivated have the requirements/benefits for cultivating the plants or seeds. HAMED FD can be used for all kind of plants and seeds. Providing that HAMED FD will be used globally, cultivated and harvested plants can be monitored around the world and some useful information (like availability of certain plants in the case of needs for medical purposes or people's daily consumption in different areas) can be obtained and managed. Thereby, HAMED FD can estimate required future needs like human resources and other facilities to handle different situations before they actually would be happened. As shown in [fig. 1], FD.DATABASE Unit stores all the data required for HAMED FD, and FD.ALGORITHMS Unit represents the correct forms of plants in different stages, from seeds to productive plants, with regard to their pests and pesticides, their needed water, soil and minerals, their needed costs and proposed revenues, and the environmental conditions in which the plants are growing in order to be controlled more easily in FD.AIU Unit for further analysis. FD.DATABASE and FD.ALGORITHMS units shape the first stream reaching FD.AIU Unit. The second stream includes FD.INPUTS and FD.PROCESSING units which then are joined to the first stream and connected to FD.AIU Unit.

The proposed system also provides the feature of providing expert advice in need. If the server alarms any abnormal situation to an individual farmer about crop and suggest for an expert advice. The server then sends the query or abnormal situation to the farming expert if requested by an individual along with the images of the agricultural field taken by camera sensor to aid in providing suitable advice. The suggested advice by the farming expert is then forwarded to the client device by the server to act accordingly. The alarms and advice may be provided to the client device as per the language selected by the individual for communication and the server machine is equipped enough to translate and provide the alarms and advice to the individual farmer in their selected language. Thus, the present system automatically increases crop production using current technology and farmers will get benefited of the technology.

Furthermore, early treatment decreases crop damage and, as a result, increases crop yield within a given season. In order to identify and predict NDS around the region, we collect sequences of aerial imagery of high-resolution and create models for semantic segmentation. Agriculture, deep learning, modern machine vision, and remote sensing all collide in our research. To begin, we create a benchmark for detection of full-field nutrient deficiency stress (NDS) and quantify the pretraining effects, architecture of backbone, representation of the input, and strategy sampling. This research leads to recent advances in deep learning (DL) for agriculture and remote sensing while also tackling a major social issue with sustainability and economic ramifications. Thus, this invention is intended in detecting the nutrient deficiency in corn fields using aerial images. Machine learning uses the aerial images in identifying and classifying the nutrient deficiency corn plant based on the severity of stress and symptom of each specific nutrient type. This invention of detecting NDS uses support vector machine (SVM) algorithm.

        "abstract": "SMART IRRIGATION ENRICHED WITH FERTILIZER MIXING AND WATER WASTAGE REDUCTION USING DEEP LEARNING Abstract The major problem faced by today's world is water scarcity. If the effective usage of water is minimal when compared with the total amount of water drawn, then water wastage is more. Even though the water scarcity persists, agriculture have to be sustained in order to satisfy the food requirements of human race. With the help of recent technologies, we can design a smart irrigation model which in turn maximizes the amount of effective usage of water in agriculture field. In this work, three varieties of sensors are used such as climatic sensors, soil sensors and soil NPK sensors. The climate sensors assess the environmental conditions and gathers the details like temperature, humidity and wind speed. These are the main factors which are responsible for rainfall. If there is a possibility for excess rain or excess wind, then the irrigation to the agriculture field will be delayed to certain time. This feature of our model is developed with deep learning technique, which in turn improves the efficiency of the machine by learning from the previous results. The soil and NPK sensors gathers the details like moisture, NPK nutrients traces in the soil of the agriculture field. The input fed to this system is, soil type, relative humidity and plant type. The output will be suggestion predicting the need for irrigation with a period and also the amount of fertilizer needed to provide the maximum yield in an agriculture field. The radio circuit model gathers the details from climate sensors and soil sensors. The data measurements of the parameters such as temperature, humidity and wind speed will be given as input to the input layer of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The processing will take place in the hidden layer and the following outputs will be produced. \u2022 Due to the prediction of excess wind in the near future, the distribution of water in unnecessary area will be avoided. \u2022 The system could provide a suggestion regarding the irrigation at right time and right quantity. \u2022 The duration of irrigation for the agriculture field is predicted accurately with the help of moisture sensors.

To increase productivity in agriculture, clever and effective agricultural techniques are therefore required. The determination of land adequacy for agriculture is a basic instrument for the growth of agriculture. Agriculture is using many emerging technologies and inventions as an approach to the gathering and distribution of agricultural knowledge. The rapid growth of wireless sensor networks has led to the creation of Internet of Things (IoT) of low cost and compact sensor devices, which are a feasible method for automating and making decisions in agriculture. This study proposes an expert framework for the evaluation of agricultural land suitability, by combining sensor networks with artificial intelligence systems such as neural networks and multi-component perceptron. This innovation would help farmers determine the farmland for agriculture according to four classes of judgment, i.e. more acceptable, suitable, reasonably appropriate and unsuitable. This measurement is based on the data from the different sensor instruments used for machine training. The results achieved by MLP with four hidden layers are seen in contrast to the other current model, to be successful for the multiclass classification system. This learned model is used to evaluate potential evaluations and to identify the land after each harvest.

A number of wired or wireless optical, electrical, thermal, chemical, biological, or other sensors are deployed in a plant's locality, possibly for its full lifecycle. These sensors provide long-term, in vivo observations of both the plant's environment and the plant itself. A plant's interaction with light is measured by persistent, cloud-connected sensors, including a spectral reflectance sensor, Chlorophyll Fluorescence detector (ChFl), ChFl imager, and a near-IR imager. This sensor data enables the in-vivo characterization of a plant's health status and photosynthetic efficiency. A cloud-powered AI system uses machine learning algorithms to model the system, recommend agricultural process improvements, and identify abnormalities associated with plant disease or pests. As the invention gets enough sensor data across various environmental conditions, an ideal target process flow can be identified for a given plant genotype, phenotype, or other additional specificity."

In particular, this invention allows the breakdown of highly complex biological spectral signals into high dimensional feature space where local features of each sub-space are accurately correlated with both a specific metabolite concentration or a categorical condition. Such is achieved by a new self-learning method, that requires no human intervention. The developed artificial intelligence is able to establish its own knowledgebase when new data is fed by performing feature space transformations, searching directions of co-variance and optimizing local composition-spectral correlations. These methods allow the artificial intelligence to establish knowledge maps of both quantifications and classifications, that can be cashed for higher computational performance. In particular, direct search comprises of finding across the feature space data and dimensions that allow a direct linear correspondence between metabolic composition and spectral bands variance. Moreover, a similar approach is derived for defining the convex hull regions of different class of health conditions from body fluid spectra. Such results in the creation of knowledge maps for both quantification and classification. The present invention also allows to evaluate 'a priori' the predictability, accuracy and precision of new estimates. Furthermore, this invention provides a self-learning approach to de definition of the global feature space using big data, for its correct characterization under high variability, accurate detection of local anomalies, as well as, outliers that can contaminate the knowledge base. This invention is applicable to all regions of the electro-magnetic spectra used in spectroscopy analysis (x-ray, uv, vis, nir, ir, far-ir and microwaves), or with any other type of spectroscopy (absorvance, reflectance, fluorescence, phosphorescence, Raman scattering) where complex multi-scale interference and biological variability is present. It further extends to fields of non-destructive, non-invasive spectroscopy applications in fields such as healthcare, veterinary, biotechnology, pharmaceutical, food and agriculture."

The 16,17-dihydroGA's are used to synergize the biological activity of exogenously supplied gibberellins. Particularly in graminaceous species, the compounds synergize the action of exogenous GA's and can, thus, be used to increase the yield of malt and decrease the amount of time required for the malting process, increase the yield of sugar cane and stimulate germination and seedling development in rice, wheat, barley, oats, rye, maize, sorghum, turf grasses and other plant species."

CONSTITUTION:When compressed air is supplied to an air supply pipe 5, it is supplied to an air supply groove 2b through an air supply opening 2g, which makes a moving table 2 float above guide surface Ia of a guide table 1. The moving table 2, however, is very unstable. Then, by performing vacuum suction from an air suction pipe 6, the gap between the guide surface 1a and a moving surface 2a becomes smaller than a vacuum suction opening 2h, as a result, stronger resistance against the compression force and stretching force from above the moving table 2 is obtained, so that flat movement hard bearing is obtained. Then, when the moving table 2 is applied with external lateral force, it is moved in the same direction as the applied external force."

In countries where the controlled environment agriculture is developed, most of greenhouse facilities can carry out management control through computer intelligent regulation and control devices and measure ecological environmental factors within the facilities (such as temperature, humidity, solar radiation, nutrient solution EC value and crop growth parameters ) through various sensors. According to optimum conditions for crop growth, a computer intelligent system can give instructions to exercise control on systems and related devices and adjust and control factors such as temperature, light, water, fertilizer and air, thereby greatly improving the productivity and finished product output capacity of the crop. Compared with the manual experience operational control, the intelligent integrated control technique can save energy by from 15 percent to 50 percent and provide all-weather 24-hour information and control support for planters with memory and inquiry function and decision support function."
